# Rendering project

A C++/OpenFrameworks rendering application that supports both Ray Tracing and Ray Marching. Initially written for the CS116B course at San Jose State University and later extended to incude more rendering features. The goal of this project is to gain more familiarity with C++ and computer graphics. Using the OpenFrameworks libraries, this project provides an interactive scene, similar to the scenes in commercial applications like Blender, as well as a graphical user interace.
